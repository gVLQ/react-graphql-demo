# React Graphql VISX Demo

My process was fairly straightforward. First, I thought out the folder structure, then I installed and integrated Apollo and GraphQL, after which I tested with the provided API. The most challenging was building and integrating the Visx histogram component, as I hadn't worked with this library before.
I think there is also a more efficient way of grabbing the data with Graphql but since I didn't have a lot of time to research, I implemented a custom method to do this in convertor.js
